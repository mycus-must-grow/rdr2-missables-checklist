## About

This is a checklist I made back in 2020 when I first played the game. It is based on [this article](https://reddead.fandom.com/wiki/Missable_Content_in_Redemption_2).

I tried to sort it by priority; what you should be collecting first.

Since it is an old thing, I think this list may miss some things from the article; I'll add that in the following days.
